exercises:
ex0:
Create a kernel modules that:
Prints message to kernel log when loaded and unloaded.
Proof of completion:
Kernel log must contain custom message after loading and unloading the module.
Opening kernel log: "tail -f /var/log/kern.log"

ex1:
Create a kernel module that:
registers a character device.
Proof of completion:
Custom device name should appear when listing devices using "cat /proc/devices"

ex2:
Create a kernel module that:
Registers a character device that can be mapped to a file using mknod command.
Allows for reading custom text from the file with "cat /dev/mydevice".
Proof of completion:
Command "cat /dev/mydevice" should give output of custom messages.

ex2b:
Create a kernel module that:
Registers a character device, maps the character device to a file (without having to execute mknod).
Proof of completion: new character file exist under /dev.

ex3: Same as ex2 except for the fact that device should output random integer from 0 to 9

ex4: create a kernel module that:
registers a character device,
then map the character device to file
file can be read or written into
The text gets stored and is printed when device is read. Writing again replaces the stored text.
example: 
$ echo "hello" >> deviceFile
$ cat deviceFile
hello
